# Heart_Disease_Prediction
To build model that can predict the heart disease existence based on known attributes from a patient. 

## About
Each year, 32% of all deaths around the world caused by Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. On average, 85% of the number were caused by heart attack and stroke. In this project, the prediction machine of heart diseases (CVDs) existence on a person will be built based 13 existence feature relate to human cardiovascular system.

## Data Description
Dataset used for this project is consist of 13 features and 1 target variables.
Feature:
1. `age` - age (in years) of each respondent (corresponding one on one with the row)
2. `sex` - gender of each respondent (1 = male ; 0 = female)
3. `cp` - chest pain type (4 values):  
Value 0 "typical angina"  
Value 1 "atypical angina"  
Value 2 "non-anginal pain"  
Value 3 "asymptomatic"
4. `trestbps` - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. `chol` - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. `fbs` - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. `restecg` - resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)   
Value 0 "normal"  
Value 1 "having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)"  
Value 2 "showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria" 
8. `thalach` - maximum heart rate achieved
9. `exang` - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. `oldpeak` - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. `slope` - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment   
Value 0 "upsloping"  
Value 1 "flat"  
Value 2 "downsloping"
12. `ca` - number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy
13. `thal`: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
